Hey :v:

I'm Joscha, a professional Software Developer and semi-professional 3<sup>rd</sup> level family IT-support living in Cologne, Germany 🔅

My main occupation is developing software at [Bayer](https://www.bayer.com/en/this-is-bayer).\
I preferably accomplish my objectives using Python and TypeScript, deployed on AWS via Terraform.

In my spare time, I like to cycle 🚲 and swim 🌊, play Basketball 🏀 and video games 🎮\
... and as you can tell by my contribution graph, I value my weekends :relieved:
